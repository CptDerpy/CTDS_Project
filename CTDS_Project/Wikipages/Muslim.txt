A Muslim (Arabic: ÙÙØ³ÙÙÙâ) is someone who follows or practices Islam, a monotheistic Abrahamic religion. Muslims consider the Quran, their holy book, to be the verbatim word of God as revealed to the Islamic prophet and messenger Muhammad. The majority of Muslims also follow the teachings and practices of Muhammad (sunnah) as recorded in traditional accounts (hadith). "Muslim" is an Arabic word meaning "submitter" (to God).The beliefs of Muslims include: that God (Arabic: Ø§ÙÙÙâ AllÄh) is eternal, transcendent and absolutely one (tawhid); that God is incomparable, self-sustaining and neither begets nor was begotten; that Islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that has been revealed before through many prophets including Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Moses, and Jesus; that these previous messages and revelations have been partially changed or corrupted over time (tahrif) and that the Qur'an is the final unaltered revelation from God (Final Testament).

The religious practices of Muslims are enumerated in the Five Pillars of Islam: the declaration of faith (shahadah), daily prayers (salat), fasting during the month of Ramadan (sawm), almsgiving (zakat), and the pilgrimage to Mecca (hajj) at least once in a lifetime.To become a Muslim and to convert to Islam is essential to utter the Shahada, one of the Five Pillars of Islam, a declaration of faith and trust that professes that there is only one God (Allah) and that Muhammad is God's messenger. It is a set statement normally recited in Arabic: lÄ Ê¾ilÄha Ê¾illÄ-llÄhu muá¸¥ammadun rasÅ«lu-llÄh (ÙÙØ§ Ø¥ÙÙÙ°ÙÙ Ø¥ÙÙÙÙØ§ Ø§ÙÙÙ ÙÙØ­ÙÙÙÙØ¯Ù Ø±ÙØ³ÙÙÙÙ Ø§ÙÙÙ)  "There is no god but Allah, (and) Muhammad is the messenger of God."In Sunni Islam, the shahada has two parts: la ilaha illa'llah (there is no god but God), and Muhammadun rasul Allah (Muhammad is the messenger of God), which are sometimes referred to as the first shahada and the second shahada. The first statement of the shahada is also known as the tahlÄ«l.In Shia Islam, the shahada also has a third part, a phrase concerning Ali, the first Shia Imam and the fourth Rashid caliph of Sunni Islam: ÙØ¹ÙÙÙ ÙÙÙÙÙ Ø§ÙÙÙ (wa Ê¿alÄ«yyun walÄ«yyu-llÄh), which translates to "Ali is the wali of God.


== Lexicology ==

The word muslim (Arabic: ÙØ³ÙÙâ, IPA: [ËmÊslÉªm]; English: , ,  or moslem , ) is the active participle of the same verb of which islÄm is a verbal noun, based on the triliteral S-L-M "to be whole, intact". A female adherent is a muslima (Arabic: ÙØ³ÙÙØ©â) (also transliterated as "Muslimah" ). The plural form in Arabic is muslimÅ«n (ÙØ³ÙÙÙÙ) or muslimÄ«n (ÙØ³ÙÙÙÙ), and its feminine equivalent is muslimÄt (ÙØ³ÙÙØ§Øª). The Arabic form muslimun is the stem IV participle of the triliteral S-L-M.
The ordinary word in English is "Muslim". It is sometimes transliterated as "Moslem", which is an older spelling. The word Mosalman (Persian: ÙØ³ÙÙØ§Ùâ, alternatively Mussalman) is a common equivalent for Muslim used in Central and South Asia. Until at least the mid-1960s, many English-language writers used the term Mohammedans or Mahometans. Although such terms were not necessarily intended to be pejorative, Muslims argue that the terms are offensive because they allegedly imply that Muslims worship Muhammad rather than God. Other obsolete terms include Muslimite and Muslimist.MusulmÃ¡n/MosalmÃ¡n (Persian: ÙØ³ÙÙØ§Ùâ) is a synonym for Muslim and is modified from Arabic. It is the origin of the Spanish word musulmÃ¡n, the (dated) German Muselmann, the French word musulman, the Polish words muzuÅmanin and muzuÅmaÅski, the Portuguese word muÃ§ulmano, the Italian word mussulmano or musulmano, the Romanian word musulman and the Greek word Î¼Î¿ÏÏÎ¿ÏÎ»Î¼Î¬Î½Î¿Ï (all used for a Muslim). In English it was sometimes spelled Mussulman and has become archaic in usage.
Apart from Persian, Spanish, Polish, Portuguese, Italian, and Greek, the term could be found, with obvious local differences, in Armenian, Dari, Pashto, Urdu, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Panjabi, Turkish, Kazakh, Uzbek, Kyrgyz, Azeri, Maltese, Hungarian, Czech, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Russian, Serbian, Ukrainian, Romanian, Dutch, and Sanskrit.


== Meaning ==
The Muslim philosopher Ibn Arabi said:

A Muslim is a person who has dedicated his worship exclusively to God...Islam means making one's religion and faith God's alone.


=== Other prophets ===
The Qur'an describes many prophets and messengers within Judaism and Christianity, and their respective followers, as Muslim: Adam, Noah, Abraham, Ishmael, Jacob, Moses, and Jesus and his apostles are all considered to be Muslims in the Qur'an. The Qur'an states that these men were Muslims because they submitted to God, preached His message and upheld His values, which included praying, charity, fasting and pilgrimage. Thus, in Surah 3:52 of the Qur'an, Jesus' disciples tell him, "We believe in God; and you be our witness that we are Muslims (wa-shahad be anna muslimÅ«n)." In Muslim belief, before the Qur'an, God had given the Tawrat (Torah) to Moses, the Zabur (Psalms) to David and the Injil (Gospel) to Jesus, who are all considered important Muslim prophets.
